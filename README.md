ADVANTAGES OF MOBILE COMMERCE 
"What’s the big deal about mobile commerce !!" you are wondering" isn’t it just an online store I have now but on a smartphone or a tablet or a laptop?". NOT EXACTLY. 
1.CONVENIENCE
WHERE'S your cell phone right now? Its probably close to your hand or maybe in your purse/pocket. AM I RIGHT? Even if we are planning to quickly look something up we know how often random searching leads to purchase .That is one of the reason e commerce is growing so much at an astronomical rate. 

 
2. A WHOLE NEW MARKET
 An increasing number of shoppers, particularly younger shoppers, use mobile commerce exclusively and many don’t even have a desktop computer anymore. A mobile friendly online store opens your e-commerce business up to this whole new demographic. Similarly, you’ll find your existing customers purchasing more simply because you’ve made it that much easier for them to do so on the go.

3. IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION
It all comes down to the time your buyers have to think their purchase over. I like that item in your online store, but by the time I go home, load your site on my desktop PC, trudge downstairs to find my wallet… I’ve had a lot of time to think about it and my enthusiasm has waned to the point where I may not buy it at all. However, if I’d had the option to purchase it the minute I first saw it on my phone when I was the most excited about it, I’d have been much more likely to complete the sale.
